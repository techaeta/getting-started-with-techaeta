# Getting Started with IBM Technology Worldwide Assets & Architecture Team

This repository is a foundational guide for contributing to and consuming from the technical content that has been provided by the IBM Technology Worldwide Assets & Archtiecture team. We will maintain a list of best practices and desired content for each repository across the organization to implement for each of their delivered assets. This will provide a positive user experience for content contributors and consumers alike!

## Usage

### Repository naming guidance

Repository names should be explicit enough to identify the asset as standalone content, but also follow any naming patterns and conventions that similar or contextual projects have already begun using.

It is desired to avoid the use of internal acronyms and project codenames in the names of repositories that are created under the [IBM Technology Worldwide Assets & Architecture Team](https://github.com/techaeta) organization. If these issues become pervasive, you may be asked to change the name of your repository or it may be changed automatically by organization owners.

If you have questions about the name of your repository, either before or after it has been created, feel free to contact anyone mentioned in [Authors and acknowledgment](#authors-and-acknowledgment) below for assistance.

### Repository description guidance

Within reason, your asset repository should have as much information as possible in the description field so that consumers of your excellent work will know exactly what they are getting into! A few short sentences should be more than enough to steer consumers in the right direction.

Additionally, once your repository is created, adding a few relevant [Topics](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) is a great way for consumers to find your content organically and through other relevantly-tagged repositories.

### Default branch guidance

Per [GitHub's `renaming` repository](https://github.com/github/renaming#from-master-to-main),

>On October 1, 2020, any new repositories you create will use **main** as the default branch, instead of **master**. This change does not impact any of your existing repositories: existing repositories will continue to have the same default branch they have now.

As this will be a long-term change with the content in this repository being created after the October 1st, 2020 transition point - any content that is migrated over from existing organizations or repositories should align with the **main** branch naming strategy for consumer consistency.

### Main README file guidance

Similar to Tom Preston-Werner's notion of [README-Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html), we want to make sure that consumers of content from the [IBM Technology Worldwide Assets & Architecture Team](https://github.com/techaeta) organization have as much context and information as they need to from their initial point of entry.

When creating new repositories inside the organization, please focus on making the repository's main README file as robust as possible, including as much relevant information as necessary for consumers to be productive within minutes!
